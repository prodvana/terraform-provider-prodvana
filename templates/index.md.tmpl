# Prodvana Provider

The Prodvana Provider is used to interact with Prodvana resources. For example, you can create a Prodvana Release Channel
where you are already creating the infrastructure required to deploy to that Release Channel.

To authenticate with Prodvana you need to provide your Organization's `org_slug` and a valid
Prodvana API Token [API token](https://docs.prodvana.io/docs/api-tokens-1).

These can be passed to the provider block in your Terraform configuration:

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

Or they can be provided as environment variables:

- `PVN_ORG_SLUG`
- `PVN_API_TOKEN`
